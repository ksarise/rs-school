 Hello! My name is Sergey Kravchenko, I am 29 years old, residing in Almaty. And perhaps I am the future junior frontend developer. Maybe  
Let's find out how I got to this point. 

 While still at school I studied basics of QBasic, Turbo Pascal and some other stuff. I liked it, but there was no clear vision and understanding of what to do, where to strive. But this did not stop me from participating in local programming competitions. Once, I even found myself in the final stage of the Eurasian International Programming Olympiad (I don’t know how). It was terrible, but I met some real programmers. This helped me understand that this area is close to me and I would like to develop further in it.  
 
 So, when it was time to choose a department to study at university, I preferred computer science. But on the other hand, my parents urged me to go to the geology department, so that I save our geology dynasty and etc. For a long time, I couldn't choose: geology or computer science.
And finally, guess what? I went to the Physics department of Novosibirsk State University!  

 I don’t remember exactly my train of thoughtб but at the time everything seemed logical to me. Obtain good technical skills applied to some interesting branch of physics, thermodynamics or optics for example. And then improve my level by learning some programming language.
 After years of study and dozens of physical and mathematical disciplines, I learned a lot of new things. But I also began to realize that even if I additionally learned and applied programming as I had planned, it was clearly not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  
 
 By that time, I had already begun to think about the problems of bad interfaces, their minor shortcomings or their absence at all. It's very simple when your only working interface is an old Soviet oscilloscope. But I still continued to work at the institute, without much understanding of what and how to change One day, I even decided to change jobs and remembered geology. Who are geologists? Tough guys who wander through the forests, lick rocks, search for and find natural resources. Sounds cool!
 And with my background it was easiest to switch to geophysics. But it was a trap.
Geophysicists generally do not wander through forests or lick rocks. They simply process physical data. And they don't even have an oscilloscope.  

 But I have more free time to look for myself and in the end I find out about front-end, which sounds like what I’ve wanted to do all my life!
I join the IT community on Twitter, start reading interesting authors, try to study something myself. And one day, deep in the replies to some tweet, I read a short story about RSS and I decide to try study.
 While studying for Stage 0 I realized two things: 
1) I don't have enough time for the course. 
2) This is what I need  

 So, from the beginning of Stage 1 I quit my job and devote all my time to studying.
And now here we are!
It's not entirely easy for me, there are some things I don't understand, but nothing replaces the joy of a working function button. Still working on making it beautiful =)
