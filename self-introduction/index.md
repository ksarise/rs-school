 ## Transcription to video  
 
 Hello! My name is Sergey , I am 29 years old, residing in Almaty. I studied at Physics department of Novosibirsk State University.
And perhaps I am the future junior frontend developer. Maybe..  

 After years of working in physical disciplines I began to realize that it was clearly not what I wanted to do and enjoy it. For several years in free time, I look for myself and, in the end, I find out about front-end, which sounds like what I’ve wanted to do all my life!
I join the IT community on Twitter, start reading interesting authors, try to study something myself. And one day, deep in the replies to some tweet, I read a short story about RSS and I decide to try study.  

 While studying for Stage 0 I realized two things: 
1) I don't have enough time for the course. 
2) This is what I need
   
 So, from the beginning of Stage 1 I quit my job and devote all my time to studying.
And now here we are!
It's not entirely easy for me, there are some things I don't understand, but nothing replaces the joy of a working function button. Still working on making it beautiful ).  

I love noticing little imperfections in the interfaces of products I use frequently. For example:
Do you know that if you send a block of code in discord, then when you click on the copy button, the code is copied, but it only works once!? It’s awful!)
This is the reason why I am interested in learning how to design and create interfaces using HTML, CSS, JS .   

I'm especially interested in React and practice graphs render right now as pet project.
React will potentially give me the opportunity to fix some interface flaws, at least for myself. At the most, I would dream of being involved in the creation of complex applications, where I could contribute and, while doing my job, at the same time make the interface better. Even at one small point I behave.
