 Hello! My name is Sergey, I am 29 years old, and residing in Almaty. I studied at the Physics department of Novosibirsk State University.
 And I may be the future junior frontend developer. Maybe..  
 
 After years of working in physical disciplines, I began to realise that it wasn’t what I wanted to do every day and enjoy it. For several years in my free time, I looked for myself, tried some things and, finally, I found out about front-end, which sounds like what I’ve wanted to do all my life
Colouring buttons sounds great, isn't it?  

 I joined the IT community on Twitter, started reading interesting authors, and tried to study something myself. Until one day, deep in the replies to some tweet, I read a short story about RSS. I thought why not and decided to give it a try.
 While studying for Stage 0 I realized two things:
 1) I don't have enough time for the course to succeed.
 2) This is what I need

 So, at the beginning of Stage 1, I quit my job and devote all my time to study.

And here we are!  

Honestly, it's not entirely easy for me, there are some things I don't understand easily plus language barrier problems (especially in wonderful test questions),  but nothing can replace the joy of a working functional button that I made myself. Still working on making it stylish ).

I love noticing little imperfections in the interfaces of products I use frequently. For example:
 Do you know that if you send a block of code in Discord, then when you click on the copy button, the code is copied, but it only works once!? It’s awful!)  
 
 This is one of the reasons why I am interested in learning how to design and create interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm especially interested in React and practice graphs render right now as a pet project. 
At least for myself, React will potentially allow me to fix some interface flaws. At most, I would dream of being involved in the creation of complex applications, where I could contribute and at the same time make the interface better. Even if I can improve one small moment.

Let's see where this goes.
